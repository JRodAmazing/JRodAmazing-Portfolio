## WHO I AM

I'm the engineer you call when AI needs to work in the real world—not in a notebook.

17+ years building systems that can't fail: **aerospace test operations**, **$485M+ industrial portfolios**, and **mission-critical software** that runs 24/7 in harsh environments. Now I architect AI solutions that solve actual business problems, not just demos.

**What makes me different:** I've stood in muddy fields at 2am troubleshooting million-dollar equipment. I've led launch operations where failure meant months of delays. I've managed international teams across time zones and language barriers. And somewhere along the way, I taught myself to code—**in the dark**, late nights, because the tools didn't exist yet.

Most AI engineers build models. I build **production systems** that integrate with ERPs, process telematics data, and survive in industrial environments. I speak **fluent business**, write **production code**, and understand **field operations**—a rare combination.

**The bottom line:** If your AI project needs to work outside a Jupyter notebook, I'm your engineer.
