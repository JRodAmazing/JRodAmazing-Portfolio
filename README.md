### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JRodAmazing/JRodAmazing-Portfolio.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd JRodAmazing-Portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env.local with:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Development

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio embodies the same principles Justin applies to AI solutions architecture:

1. **Architecture-First**: End-to-end system design with scalability in mind
2. **Production-Ready**: Every component is built to ship, not just demo
3. **Performance-First**: Optimized animations, lazy loading, minimal bundle size
4. **Observability**: Built-in monitoring, logging, and performance tracking patterns
5. **Maintainable**: TypeScript for type safety, modular component architecture
6. **Scalable**: Designed to grow with new projects and features

The portfolio itself demonstrates architectural principles with a technical blueprint watermark background—a visual representation of systems thinking.

**Built with precision. Deployed with confidence. Just like production AI systems should be.**

*"He's been on both sides of the problem. Most developers haven't stood in a muddy field troubleshooting equipment at 2am. Most operations people can't write production code. Justin's done both."* – AXIOM, AI Representative
